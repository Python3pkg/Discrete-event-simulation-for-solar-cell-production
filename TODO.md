TODO
====

- Render message when throughput is (momentarily) limited by full output
- Introduce microstops: operator action needed to restart machine; define frequency per hour and duration
- Fix bug with >100% util rate BatchClean
- Implement ion implant
- Extract waiting times between tools/processes somehow; have operators make note of times for example or implement stores instead of containers
- Add load/save feature for individual tools

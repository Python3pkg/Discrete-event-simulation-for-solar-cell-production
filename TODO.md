TODO
====

- Implement speed up of inline tools, similar way to SSE
- Implement down-time settings for whole tools (SSE in particular)
- Implement down-time settings for tube furnace and PECVD
- Implement ion implant
- Add calculation of nominal speed and generate utilization rate
- Measure/store vital parameters in pandas DataFrame, eg:
  - Production volume vs time for each tool
  - Production throughput vs time for each tool
  - Buffer sizes in between all tools vs time
- Add load/save feature for individual tools?

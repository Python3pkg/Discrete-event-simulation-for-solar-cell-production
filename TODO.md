- Change batchconnections dicts to lists in TubeFurnace and PECVD (same as in Transport)
- Implement flexible batchtex tool
- Implement ion implant
- Implement down-time schedules
- Measure/store vital parameters in pandas DataFrame, eg:
  - Production volume vs time for each tool
  - Production throughput vs time for each tool
  - Buffer sizes in between all tools vs time
- Add load/save feature for individual tools?
